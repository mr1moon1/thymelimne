	<p class=center>Thanks for checking this out!</p>
	<p class=center>The point of this is to make timelines of things.</p>
	<p class=center>The first three examples (english coronations, mcu, beatles discography) have strange descriptions because they were auto-generated. Additionally, to brag a bit, the background & color schemes for each page are created by software on the app.</p>
	<br></br>
	<br></br>
	<p class=center><em>Known bugs:</em><ul>
		<li class=center style="width:95%;">Ideally, the moment a user creates a new topic via "create", the app does an image search on the subject. That part of the app is currently down, and will need to be rewritten. Stay tuned or whatnot</li>
		<br>
		<li class=center style="width:95%">Some entries on the timelines overlap. That bug's understood; it just didn't get prioritized yet.</li>
		<br>
		<li class=center style="width:95%">The "create" button (hopefully) works properly, but it's not designed at all. I just... don't care about user authentication. I don't care if that part's pretty or not. Hope it works, though.</li>
		<br>
		<li class=center style="width:95%">Sometimes the background pic is too small for the window, so you see a sharp borderline on the right. That's something I personally notice, but is probably not worth prioritizing.</li>
	</ul></p>
